A Data Engineer based in Indonesia with a strong focus on building scalable, reliable, and analytics-ready data platforms. I specialize in designing end-to-end data pipelines, transforming raw data into trusted datasets, and enabling data-driven decision making.

My daily work revolves around Python and SQL, along with modern data stack tools such as Databricks, Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, and cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP). I enjoy tackling complex data problems—whether it’s optimizing ETL workflows, modeling data marts, or ensuring data quality and consistency at scale..

This GitHub is a space where I share projects, experiments, and solutions related to data engineering and analytics. Contributions, discussions, and pull requests are always welcome—let’s build impactful data solutions together.
